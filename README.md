# auth-guard-v2

auth-guard-v2 is a project that includes api-gateway and rest-api, providing authentication with client credentials flow.

The auth0.com platform developed by Okta was used in the development of this project.

## Usage

```
- open a terminal and go to that folder where you want to save the project.

- git clone https://github.com/jiin-yang/auth-guard-v2.git

- cd api-gateway
- go run .

- cd ..

- cd employee-api
- go run .
```


## Requests

Creating a new employee is protected. You can access all employees publicly.

Example curl requests for these requests;

```
1-) GET ACCESS TOKEN

curl --location 'http://localhost:3010/token'
```

```
2-) CREATE EMPLOYEE

curl --location 'http://localhost:3010/employees' \
--header 'authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "EMPLOYEE_NAME",
    "department": "DEPARTMENT_NAME"
}'
```
```
3-) GET ALL EMPLOYEES

curl --location 'http://localhost:3010/employees'
```

## Notes

My purpose; Preventing external access to employee-api methods that need to be protected and only accessing requested resources through api-gateway.

#### Flow:
```
1-) First of all, you must own the token. You can send a GET /token request to the api-gateway.

This request is for you; Filling in the client_id, client_secret, grand_type and auth0_audience information, it gets the access_token generated by the auth0.com platform.

2-) Now we will use this token to access protected methods. You must add key:"authorization" value:"Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN> to the Header section when making a request.

3-) This token you send in the header is validated in the api-gateway project before going to the employee-api. Validation is done by the 'CustomValidToken' middleware function.

By creating a machine-to-machine application on the Auth0 platform, I have the necessary tools to implement client credentials flow. My application's client_id, client_secret, domain and audience address are specified in the .env file.

4-) For protected methods in Employee service; It is necessary to verify the access token in the incoming request. If I don't verify, applications with endpoints of the employee service can access my employee service without any protection.

For this, I parse the incoming token and, since I use the RSA256 algorithm, I verify using my JSON Web Key Set, that is my public key.
